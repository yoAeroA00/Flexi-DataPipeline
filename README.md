# Flexi-DataPipeline

Introduction

Welcome to the FlexibleDataPipeline_OCR-LLM-MongoDB project! This repository hosts a robust and adaptable data pipeline designed to convert images and PDFs, including prescriptions, into a defined JSON schema. Leveraging the power of Azure OCR and Azure AI (ChatGPT), this pipeline efficiently processes diverse image types, transforming them into structured data stored in MongoDB. The flexibility of the code allows easy adaptation to different input formats and schemas, making it a versatile solution for various data processing needs.

Feel free to customize this introduction to better match the specifics and nuances of your project.
